// This file contains a collection of methods that can be used from go-restful to
// generate Swagger API documentation for its models. Please read this PR for more
// information on the implementation: https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/pull/215
//
// TODOs are ignored from the parser (e.g. TODO(andronat):... || TODO:...) if and only if
// they are on one line! For multiple line or blocks that you want to ignore use ---.
// Any context after a --- is ignored.
//
// Those methods can be generated by using hack/update-generated-swagger-docs.sh

// AUTO-GENERATED FUNCTIONS START HERE. DO NOT EDIT.

RuntimeClasses are (currently) manually defined by a user or cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is responsible for resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the pod.  For more details, see https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md",

The possible values are specific to the node & CRI configuration.  It is assumed that all handlers are available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every node. For example, a handler called \"runc\" might specify that the runc OCI runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The Handler must conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and is immutable.",
